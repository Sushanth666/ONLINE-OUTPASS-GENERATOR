# outpass

OutPass system for hostels where students get to take permission of both their respective HOD's and their Chief Wardens just by filling up a simple form.

The Student fills the outpass form and waits for the reply from the authorities. the Hod gets all the Outpass Applications from students of his branch and have the power weather to accept or reject the form. If accepted the the form gets passed to Warden for further confirmation else the status of "rejected" starts displaying on the student's status page. Further if Hod approves the application the form reaches the Warden where he/she takes further steps of verification and decides weather to approve or reject the Outpass.

The Project uses EJS, CSS, bootstrap, FLexbox for Front-End NodeJS, Express for Back-End and MySql for Database.
